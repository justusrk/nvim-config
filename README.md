# Neovim Configuration

I can use this neovim config for neovide and also inside VS Code (in some sad situations).

Neovide is nice because all key bindings work and easier for my eyes to track the cursor.

## Installation 

1. Install ripgrep and sqlite (for Telescope)

2. ln -s . ~/.config/nvim

3. Install Lazy Packages

4. Install Mason Packages
